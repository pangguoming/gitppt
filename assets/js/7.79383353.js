Traditional relational databases have limited exploration and utilization of complex networked data. Therefore, a special tool is needed: graph databases. Currently, most graph databases on the market are foreign products that are large in scale, cumbersome, and expensive. They are not suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises or small projects. Many business scenarios do not want to migrate all business data to a graph database, but only want to implement a graph data functionality module. It is even more impractical to purchase a large-scale graph database.
